# Vaporwave_Gif_VJ_Network
A TouchDesigner network that randomly shuffles and layers gifs, then applies various visual effects (noise, pixel stretching, feedback) and blend modes to them. Can be used for projections and other VJ-related purposes. Download the gifs used in this network at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B0R7wvl9X0gn3GuDpZZY3Rj9ixb66AJp
